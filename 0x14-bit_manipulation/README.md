## Tasks

### Task 0: Binary to Unsigned Int

Function: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)`

Converts a binary number represented as a string to an unsigned int.

### Task 1: Print Binary Representation

Function: `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)`

Prints the binary representation of a given unsigned long int number.

### Task 2: Get Bit

Function: `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`

Returns the value of a bit at a given index in a given unsigned long int number.

### Task 3: Set Bit

Function: `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index in a given unsigned long int number.

### Task 4: Clear Bit

Function: `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index in a given unsigned long int number.

### Task 5: Flip Bits

Function: `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)`

Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one unsigned long int number to another.

## Usage

To use these functions, simply include the respective header file in your C program and call the functions with the appropriate arguments.

## Testing

You can test the functions by compiling the provided test files along with the implementation files. Each test file contains sample usage of the functions.
